# Crypto Clustering Analysis

This project conducts a clustering analysis of cryptocurrencies to identify patterns and group similar crypto assets based on their market behavior and other features.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains all the code and visualizations for the clustering analysis.

- `Resources/`: This directory contains datasets used in the analysis.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis consists of several steps:

1. Data Collection: Data related to different cryptocurrencies is gathered.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering are performed to prepare the data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploration of data is conducted to understand distributions and relationships.

4. Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the feature space and capture the most important variance.

5. Clustering: K-Means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies.

6. Evaluation: Cluster validity is assessed using metrics such as inertia and silhouette score.

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies


3. Open the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Ensure all data files are placed in the `data/` directory.

2. Execute the notebook cells in order.

3. Review the generated plots in the `plots/` directory for visual insights.

4. Analyze the output of the clustering to draw conclusions about the cryptocurrency market structure.
